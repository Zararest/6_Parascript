The first thing to do is to assign the iterator some properties. Until C++17 this is done by tagging it with the tag dispatch mechanism, 
while C++20 uses concepts: in this article I will follow the traditional approach.

overload_set{example}

    sum(int b, char v, name){

        asm{

        }
    }


{name} <[int a, char b] sum(32, a, name); 
        a = a + b;
        tmp->[a, 2]  >
